var mineral_info = [" Very hard (H=7) and lacks cleavage. Possesses a semi-conchoidal fracture. Because it is the last mineral to crystallize in an igneous rock, it usually doesn’t have room to form any perfect crystal faces. That means it usually has an amorphous shape when found in an igneous rock. When pure it is colorless, but it routinely contains small impurities that give it a translucent white (milky quartz), rose (rose quartz), yellow, or gray color.","Hard (H=6) and has well-developed cleavage in two directions that are perpendicular to each other. Crystals are often rectangular (lath shape) and possess at least some good crystal faces. Color can vary but is usually white or salmon pink. The pink variety is distinctive. The white variety can be confused with plagioclase feldspar (see description of that mineral) or milky quartz. Quartz is usually more translucent and lacks a lath shape.","Hard (H=6) and has good cleavage in two perpendicular directions. Crystals are often lath-shaped and possess at least some good crystal faces. Na and Ca substitute readily for one another, so the mineral can have any percentage of Na relative to Ca from 0-100%. Color varies from white to dark gray, with the darker hues found in the more Ca-rich varieties. White to light gray is most common. It can be confused with quartz but can be distinguished by its lath shape and the fact that it is less translucent. White potassium feldspar can be easily confused with the lighter, more Na-rich varieties of plagioclase, and both of them commonly occur together in some igneous rocks. Look on a weathered rock surface to see if one population of feldspars possesses a pearly luster and the other is earthy. Because feldspars turn earthy as they weather and because plagioclase chemically weathers more rapidly than does potassium feldspar, the earthy minerals are likely plagioclase whereas the pearly ones are potassium feldspar.","Quite soft (H=3) and possesses 3 excellent cleavages, none of which are perpendicular to one another. Big, fresh crystals have a vitreous luster but the smaller crystals that are more typical in limestone are earthy. It is usually white to light gray. Based on color alone it can be confused with quartz, either feldspar, or gypsum, but its softness and the fact that it fizzes vigorously in hydrochloric acid easily distinguish it.","Extremely soft (H=2) and possesses 3 good cleavages, none of which are perpendicular to one another. Big, fresh crystals have a vitreous luster but smaller crystals are earthy. Small crystals are usually white but large ones are clear. Based on color alone it can be confused with quartz, either feldspar, or calcite, but its exteme softness and the fact that it doesn’t fizz in acid help to distinguish it from those minerals.","Extremely soft (H=2) and has a dull, earthy luster. When you handle it, a chalky substance typically comes off in your hand due to its extremely soft nature. It’s crystals are microscopically small, as it is a clay mineral. It can be confused with gypsum or calcite based on color alone but it possesses only 1 cleavage (which is often hard to spot), it doesn’t fizz in acid, and it is earthy rather than vitreous, which distinguishes it from those other minerals.","Very soft (H=2.5) and possesses 3 good cleavages that are mutually perpendicular. Big, fresh crystals are clear. It doesn’t fizz in acid and it tastes salty (to be expected, given that it IS table salt!).","Chert is simply microscopically small crystals of quartz, so it shares many of quartz’s properties. It is very hard (H=7) and lacks cleavage. It possesses a good conchoidal fracture and it holds a sharp edge when flaked. It has a luster like that of unglazed porcelain. Impurities commonly color it red (when it is known as jasper), yellow, or gray.","Muscovite belongs to the mica family of minerals, meaning it possesses one perfect cleavage. The silica tetrahedra in micas form thin sheets, like sheets of paper. Those sheets then stack one upon the next, like a ream of paper. You can easily peel apart the individual sheets with your fingernail. This cleavage is the most distinctive property of all micas. Individual muscovite sheets are clear but when many are stacked together the resulting ‘book’ of mica sheets looks silvery.","Soft (H=2.5-3). Biotite is another mica, like muscovite, so it possesses the very distinctive single perfect cleavage. It is distinguished from muscovite by its dark brown to black color. It is most commonly confused with hornblende or pyroxene but the three are all distinguished from one another by their very different cleavage patterns.","Soft (H=2-2.5). Chlorite is also a mica with excellent cleavage but its crystals are usually too tiny to make it easy to identify by cleavage. It is green and its small green crystals are often responsible for giving some metamorphic rocks (such as greenstones) their green color.","Reasonably hard (H=5.5). Hornblende is the most common member of the amphibole mineral family. Like the other amphiboles, it possesses two good cleavages that lie at angles of 60º and 120º to each other. It is usually black or dark brown. It is most commonly confused with biotite or pyroxene but the three are all distinguished from one another by their very different cleavage patterns.","Pyroxenes are a family of minerals. The most common is augite, which is the type of pyroxene described here. Reasonably hard (H=5.5-6). Like all pyroxenes, it possesses two good cleavages that are perpendicular to one another. It is usually black or dark green. It is distinguished from olivine, biotite, and hornblende by its distinctive cleavage pattern.","Hard (H=7) and lacks cleavage. It possesses a conchoidal fracture. It is usually some shade of green, from light to dark, but can also be brown or brownish-yellow. It is distinguished from pyroxene, with which it is most commonly confused, by its lack of cleavage. It is also the first mineral to chemically weather, so it is common to find iron-stained pits in a rock where olivine crystals once existed.","It has a wide range of hardness (H=1-6) and no cleavage. When it forms in tiny crystals (which is the type you encounter most often) it is red or orange and has an earthy luster (it is, quite literally, rust). Larger crystals (most commonly seen in rock shops but important in some rock types) are steel gray and have a metallic luster. Hematite is one of the most common minerals formed via the chemical weathering of iron-rich rock-forming minerals, so it frequently forms a red or orange surface veneer on rocks. Where sediment grains are coated with a thin veneer of hematite, it turns the sedimentary rock red through and through (making the rock a so-called ‘red bed’)."]
